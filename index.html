        <h2>Ruxandra</h2>
        <p>Sarah was the biggest fan of her dad's blues band and as a kid spent many a Sunday afternoon hanging out with the
          band. Following a brief foray into nursing, she now leads the communications work of a number of young startups
          around Geneva. Sarah's unique voice has been described as a mix of Evanescence's Amy Lee with a Chris Cornell-like
          edge.
